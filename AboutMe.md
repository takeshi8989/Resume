## About Me

I am currently a 3rd-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). After completing my Bachelor's degree, I plan to continue my studies at UBC, enrolling in a Master of Science program in Computer Science.

Currently, my main interests lie in robotics, reinforcement learning, and our brain systems. My goal is to automate industries using robotics.

## Background

- Born and raised in Japan, I dedicated my life to baseball until the age of 18.
- Initially enrolled in Hosei University in Japan, but after four months, I decided to drop out and move to Canada.
- At the same time, I began learning programming and computer science, immersing myself in web and mobile development.
- Co-founded a company called **Matchya** with a friend, who is also a software engineer. We aimed to support the engineer hiring process using AI, but the venture was unsuccessful.
- Developed an interest in robotics, driven by my desire to explore the frontiers of technology.
- Through my experience at **Chitose Robotics**, a Japanese company, I became convinced that intelligent robots will play a key role in automating industries in the future.
- I am committed to answering the question of how we move and applying that understanding to robotics, with the goal of transforming society.

## My life and career

### When I was a baseball kid

### My Journey to Canada

From a young age, baseball had always been a part of my life, so much so that I can't even remember when it started. My life was always filled with "goals" and "teammates." However, after I retired from baseball, partly due to COVID-19, I realized that I had neither of those things in my hands after high school. I felt like something was missing in my life, and during that time, I came across a [book](https://www-amazon-com.translate.goog/%E5%83%95%E3%81%AF%E5%90%9B%E3%81%AE%E3%80%8C%E7%86%B1%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AB%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E3%81%97%E3%82%88%E3%81%86__%E3%83%99%E3%83%B3%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%94%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%81%8C%E6%8C%91%E7%99%BA%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B7%E6%97%A5%E9%96%93%E3%81%AE%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5%E8%AC%9B%E7%BE%A9/dp/4478108706?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc) by the venture capitalist ANRI, which inspired me to take on the world. At that point, I didn’t know exactly where I was headed, but I knew that if I wanted to compete on the global stage, I couldn’t stay in Japan. That’s when I decided to move to Canada.

### Exploring Software Development

When I began learning software development, I quickly discovered the thrill of bringing my ideas to life through code. I learned both frontend and backend development, as well as infrastructure technologies. TypeScript, Python, and C++ became my favorite languages. The satisfaction of improving my skills and seeing others use what I built became a driving force for me. Each day, I chased that feeling of accomplishment and growth.

### The Matchya Experience

With the ability to develop high-quality products, I co-founded Matchya, a service aimed at helping recruiters evaluate software engineers' skills through AI-powered technical interviews. We hoped to streamline the hiring process so internal engineers could focus on product development. However, we soon realized that psychological barriers, like the reluctance of people to be assessed by AI, held us back. Additionally, I felt the product wasn’t unique enough, as others could easily build something similar.

Although it didn’t succeed in the end, Matchya was a valuable learning experience. It helped me understand the societal impact of technology and gave me the opportunity to reconsider my own life's purpose.

### My Path into Robotics

After wrapping up Matchya and reevaluating what I wanted to do, I realized that I wanted to contribute to scientific progress and bring about significant changes in society. I strongly resonated with the idea presented by Peter Thiel in [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) that, compared to innovations in the world of bits, atoms have stagnated. The realization led me to focus on robotics, because while software services have transformed the world in remarkable ways, I felt that physical innovations, like space exploration in the 1990s, were far more groundbreaking, and the changes we see today are not as significant.

### Lessons from Chitose Robotics

Chitose Robotics is a company that provides control system software for robotic arms. During my time there, I witnessed both the potential and the challenges of the robotics industry firsthand. On one hand, the social value that robots can bring is immense—automation can lead to exponential increases in productivity. On the other hand, I came face-to-face with the reality that current technology still struggles with even the simplest tasks. From object detection difficulties in vision-based programming to hardware constraints that prevent robots from grasping objects properly, I gained a deeper understanding of the current state of robotics.

### Building the Future

I believe that in the future, robots will become more intelligent and capable of performing almost all tasks currently carried out by humans. When that happens, our existing economic and social systems will need to be rebuilt, and the way people live will also change drastically. While there may be pros and cons, this future is inevitable, and I want to be one of the first to bring it to life. I’m excited about this future and, for now, I’m fully committed to expanding the potential of robotics.

## Hobbies
### Sports
My number one hobby is sports.
Whether it’s baseball, basketball, soccer, or anything. I feel happiest when I’m playing sports with others!

### Manga
I also really enjoy manga. As a child, I was almost always reading manga, and I’ve read the entire 70+ volume series Major over 10 times. I learned Japanese more by reading manga than by talking to people. (This is true!) Some of my favorites include:

- One Piece
- Vagabond
- Space Brothers
- Naruto
- Attack on Titan

There are many others I love as well!

### Walking
I also love walking, and once, while I was in Japan, I even experimented with walking for an entire day just to see how far I could go.

Normally, I take more casual walks that last around an hour. The day after this, I couldn't move my legs, so I had to creep around.
